    "This morning we will focus on another fundamental component of programming in general and Python in particular - **functions**. Functions in Python are very similar to mathematical functions - they take an input and perform a sub-routine, often but not always returning an output. We will run through a series of commonly used Python functions built in to the language. We will also learn to write our own functions to help organize our own code. Lastly, we will touch on some common **methods** - functions which belong to specific objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are the basic means to manage complexity in your programs, allowing you to avoid nesting and repeating large chunks of code that could otherwise make your tasks unmanageable. They allow you to bundle code with a defined input and output into single lines, and you should use them frequently from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a number of so-called 'built-in' functions - functions which are always avaliable to use, without loading addition code repositories. You've already seen the **raw_input** function yesterday."

Large code blocks, with a few function calls, are only tens of lines long, and many functions are only a handful of lines. This allows us to program in large, structural sweeps, rather than getting lost in the details. This makes programs both easier to write and easier to read.\n",
