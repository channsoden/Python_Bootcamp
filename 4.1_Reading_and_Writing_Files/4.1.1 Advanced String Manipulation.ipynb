    "We've learned so far how we can write programs to make many, many decisions with an ordered logic to process information. What we've lacked thus far is how to input and output large tomes of data. In addition to manipulating large amounts of data with functions that open, read, write, and close files, we'll also benefit from learning about Python's marvelously powerful abilities to process text. Not to malign the now-dead king of text-processing languages, Perl (The King is Dead! Long Live the King!), Python really cleans house with it's unparalleled text-processing abilities with respect to both speed and ease of use."

    "\n",
    "We've learned about writing our own *functions* to process information. Many types of objects have special built-in functions. We call these functions *methods*, and in a broader discussion of objected-oriented programming practice and theory, we would have much, much more to say about them. However, we're not getting into the object-oriented universe or philosophy here, so you'll have to take as explanation simply that some objects are so routinely manipulated with the same sorts of operations that it pays to have functions dedicated to their processing. In the case of strings and files today, we'll see the *methods* that routinely operate on these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas a *function* is written to accept *arguments* and process those *arguments*, a *method* processes the object to which it belongs and is *called* differently. Whereas a *function* such as **sorted** is called by typing **sort(list_variable)**, etc, a *method* is called by typing a period and the name of the *method* at the end of the object. For example, if *print* were a *method*, it would be called like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'Hello, World!'.print() \n",
